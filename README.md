# Disc Golf TeamMaker

### This randomizer was created for YouTuber TQM_gg as they planned a small private tournament. Created to be modular, this website will take advantage of your local storage. Use it on your phone and if you usually play with the same group of people you will be set with minimal need to update every time. -- You are welcome to use this to randomize teams for any of your disc golf matches. Don't forget to follow Peachy Disc Golf on Youtube to see what shenanigans they get up too.
